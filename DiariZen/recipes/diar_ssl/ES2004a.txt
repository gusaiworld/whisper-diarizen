[14.40s -> 23.70s] Are we, we're not allowed to turn the lights so we can see that a little better?Yeah.Okay.Am I supposed to be standing up there? SPEAKER_2
[26.50s -> 34.50s] So we've got both of these clipped on.Is she going to answer me?Yeah.Right, both of them.Okay.Yeah. SPEAKER_1
[43.30s -> 51.80s] God.Is this going to fall off?It doesn't. SPEAKER_None
[80.70s -> 193.50s] Okay.Hello, everybody.I'm Sarah, project manager.And this is our first meeting.Okay, this is our agenda.We will do some stuff, get to know each other a bit better, feel more comfortable with each other.Then we'll go do tool training, talk about the project plan, discuss our own ideas and everything.And we've got 25 minutes to do that, as far as I can understand.Now, we're developing a remote control.Which you probably already know.We want it to be original, something that people haven't thought of, it's not out in the shops, trendy, appealing to a wide market, but, you know, not a hunk of metal, and user-friendly, grannies to kids, maybe even pooches should be able to use it.Okay, first is the functional design.This is where we all go off and do our individual work.Okay.And what needs need to be fulfilled by the product, what effect the product has to have, and how it's actually going to do that.Conceptual design, what we're thinking, how it's going to go, and then the detailed design, how we're actually going to put it into practice and make it work.Okay, right.We're going to practice with the pens and draw our favorite animal on the whiteboard.I'll go first.And sum up the characteristics of that animal.So, okay.There's space for everyone else.Um. SPEAKER_2
[213.50s -> 213.50s] Let me keep going. SPEAKER_1
[217.50s -> 238.50s] If you have any questions, you can put it in the chat box in the chat box or, you know, the chat box, as well, we can talk a little bit.Thank you.And we'll see you in other sessions.Thank you.You're welcome.Thank you.Bye. SPEAKER_None
[255.10s -> 277.40s] I'm not going to ask you to guess, I'm going to tell you that's supposed to be a tiger.I see them as majestic, and independent, and proud.Now, who would like to go next?Okay? SPEAKER_2
[287.10s -> 287.10s] Where does this come from? SPEAKER_0
[289.10s -> 289.10s] There you go. SPEAKER_2
[291.10s -> 297.10s] Yep, thank you.Maybe you can guess what I'm trying to make. SPEAKER_0
[307.10s -> 309.10s] A kind of dog?Yep. SPEAKER_1
[315.10s -> 349.10s] It's actually a sitting.Sorry?It's sitting, it's not standing.Okay, I see it as one thing, it's very supportive.It's your best friend in your...You can talk to a dog, it can be your best friend.It doesn't discriminate between you, based on what you are.Second, it's loyal.And third thing, it's got intuition.I mean, dogs can sometimes make out between a thief and a...I don't know.So basically, these are the three unique features I think belong to a dog. SPEAKER_0
[351.10s -> 351.10s] Okay, thank you. SPEAKER_2
[353.10s -> 353.10s] Thank you. SPEAKER_0
[355.10s -> 355.10s] Yeah, okay. SPEAKER_3
[357.10s -> 361.10s] Sorry.Please leave me a space at the bottom, I'm a little...Oh, right. SPEAKER_1
[363.10s -> 373.10s] Standing on a chair.Well, since you guys have chosen the ones I wanted to do...Okay.It has to be something a bit random.And also, my drawing skill isn't that great. SPEAKER_3
[377.10s -> 379.10s] Well, as you can see, the quality of the work today is...I think it's outstandingly good. SPEAKER_1
[383.10s -> 385.10s] Okay, now I'm going to have to change what it was originally going to be,because that looks like a beak now, so... SPEAKER_3
[393.10s -> 393.10s] Crocodile? SPEAKER_1
[395.10s -> 405.10s] Yeah, it can be a crocodile.It can be a crocodile.Firstly, it was an attempt at a T-Rex,and then it sort of changed into a pelican,but it can be a crocodile. SPEAKER_3
[421.10s -> 421.10s] That's lovely. SPEAKER_2
[423.10s -> 441.10s] Yeah, and...I'll have to think on the spot of things that it is.Scary...Strong...Yeah, that's about it, I think. SPEAKER_3
[443.10s -> 461.10s] Okay.I'm very impressed with your artistic skills.Mine are dreadful.Oops, this is now coming apart.Let me just put the top in.I hope that clicks in.I'll hold it on.Oops, oh dear.What happened there? SPEAKER_1
[463.10s -> 463.10s] Technical help. SPEAKER_2
[467.10s -> 485.10s] Hopefully that'll stay on.Two-handed version.Okay.Again, this is off the top of my head.I was going to do a big cat, too.Oh dear, it doesn't look like what I want it to be.It's not a vampire bat, honestly. SPEAKER_1
[487.10s -> 487.10s] It's not a vampire bat, honestly. SPEAKER_None
[489.10s -> 495.10s] It's not a vampire bat, honestly.And somewhere there's a body behind. SPEAKER_1
[497.10s -> 497.10s] That's my dreadful... SPEAKER_None
[499.10s -> 499.10s] That's my dreadful... SPEAKER_3
[501.10s -> 557.10s] That's the worst...It's meant to be an eagle.You can tell it's a flying animal.It could have been a seagull.I never thought of a seagull.Again, I'm thinking on my fate. Goodness.I suppose they're also independent.I'll put that one down again.They're good at golf.Independent, right.Did you say they're good at golf?Eagle.Oh, right. I'm not good at golf.I'll say they're quite free-spirited.Flying around everywhere.Doing their own thing.Birds of prey, aren't they?Oh dear. Intrepid.Intrepid.There we go.I hope that pen's going to be okay. SPEAKER_1
[559.10s -> 559.10s] Whoops. SPEAKER_2
[561.10s -> 561.10s] Okay. SPEAKER_None
[563.10s -> 575.10s] That was fine.Right.Finance-wise,we've got a selling price at 25 euros,which I don't...I don't actually know what that is in pounds at all.Any ideas? SPEAKER_2
[577.10s -> 577.10s] It's about... SPEAKER_3
[579.10s -> 581.10s] 17?1.4 euro would make a pound or something. SPEAKER_0
[583.10s -> 587.10s] Yeah, yeah, something like that.Yeah, about 17.17 pounds. SPEAKER_3
[589.10s -> 589.10s] Should we be making notes of this? SPEAKER_2
[591.10s -> 591.10s] We can just refer to this later, can't we? SPEAKER_1
[595.10s -> 595.10s] I think so. I think so. I'd be able topull it up or put it in the shared folder. SPEAKER_2
[603.10s -> 607.10s] Having said that, though, if you want to getone of those, the ones on the marketat the moment, they're about20 pounds anyway.Right.Yeah, we have to buy one. SPEAKER_3
[611.10s -> 613.10s] So I suppose later it dependsif we want to undercut the price,or is it going to make our product look SPEAKER_1
[617.10s -> 617.10s] a cheapy, cheapy option?Yeah, production costs at 12.50, SPEAKER_2
[619.10s -> 619.10s] so... SPEAKER_0
[625.10s -> 629.10s] half of the selling priceis taken up bybuilding it.And profit aim is50 million euros, SPEAKER_2
[631.10s -> 631.10s] which is a... SPEAKER_1
[633.10s -> 637.10s] Yeah.I presume so. SPEAKER_2
[645.10s -> 655.10s] You've got market rangeinternational, and you did say earlierit's got to be accessible and usableby sort of all age groups.Just we're not focusingon business market, any particular thing.It's everyone, user friendly to everyone.Okay.Big target group. SPEAKER_1
[657.10s -> 705.10s] Yes, yes. I don't think we have to...I don't think it's a case of worrying aboutdifferent languages and things like that.No.Making that key point,just that it's going to be in the international marketlike Australia, America, things like that.Okay.What are your experienceswith remote controls?I mean, I've got...We got...We had three videos, a TV,and a sort of ampthing all set up.So we got one of the universalthat you programeach of your things into.But that kept losing the signals.So we'd have to reprogram it every now and again.I think it was quite cheapy as well.So that might have had something to do with it.But that was quite good, the fact that you could SPEAKER_2
[707.10s -> 707.10s] use all the ones. SPEAKER_3
[711.10s -> 711.10s] You didn't have six remote controls in front of you.You want to integrate everything into one. SPEAKER_0
[713.10s -> 735.10s] Yeah.My experience has only been being given the remotecontrol with the object I buy,not doing any tampering with it in programming,using it to program TVand videos and things.But basically on, off, volume, up and down,channel one, two, that basic function,I don't think I could go any further with itthan that.So I suppose it's got to besomething usable by someone like me as well. SPEAKER_1
[737.10s -> 751.10s] Yeah, that's the main stuff anyway.I mean,and you don't want to...I hate looking at a controland seeing a million tiny little buttonswith tiny little words saying what they all doand just sitting there searchingfor the teletext button or something. SPEAKER_2
[753.10s -> 755.10s] Symbols that you don't necessarily understand.Symbols you're meant to understand SPEAKER_1
[757.10s -> 757.10s] that you don't. SPEAKER_0
[771.10s -> 779.10s] When you've got the main thingson the front of itand a section opens upor somethingto the other functionswhen you can do sound or optionskind of recording,things like that inside it.Because when you pick it upit doesn't make it really complicated to look at.It's obvious what you're doing. SPEAKER_2
[781.10s -> 795.10s] Actually, that just raises a point.I wonder what our design people think.But you know on a mobile phoneyou can press a key and it gives you a menu.It's got a menu display.I wonder if incorporating that into the designof a remote control might be useful.So you've got a little LCD display. SPEAKER_1
[797.10s -> 811.10s] I was thinking on the same lines.Instead of having too many buttonsand make it complicated for the user,maybe have an LCD display or something like thatlike a mobile.With menus.And if it's somewhat similar to what you have on a mobile phonepeople might find it easier to browse and navigate also. SPEAKER_0
[813.10s -> 821.10s] What about the older generation?What about granny and grandad?My grandad can answer his mobile phonebut he couldn't even dream of texting SPEAKER_2
[827.10s -> 831.10s] or something like that.Can he program his remote controlor is he basic with that too?I don't think they teach that.My grandad's actually better than me SPEAKER_1
[833.10s -> 833.10s] at using teletext. SPEAKER_3
[839.10s -> 845.10s] So that's a problemregardless of any design modificationsyou come up with.That's going to be a problem anywayfor the older generation perhaps.And that's another issue how we tackle that. SPEAKER_1
[853.10s -> 863.10s] It just needs to beas long as it's self-intuitiveand you can work outwhy everything's doing.Because I mean,menus on new phones nowthey've got all these picturesand stuffwhich makes it fairly obvious SPEAKER_3
[867.10s -> 885.10s] what you're trying to do.I don't know how.I don't like the new phonesthat have a Windows based running system.I find it really confusing.I kept getting lost in the phone.I've not got a new onebut my friend got a new oneand I was trying to do things with itand I just kept getting lostbut that's just me. SPEAKER_2
[893.10s -> 899.10s] I don't know howfor €25 or €12.50how much of an excellent screenyou could get.You'd have to sort ofkeep it down to ablack and white LCD thing anyway. SPEAKER_3
[907.10s -> 913.10s] It's possible that for the older generationyou could have an extra buttonthat you press for large printlike you do in large print books.Obviously it displays less on the screenbut as long as they can read itthat's the main thing. SPEAKER_1
[933.10s -> 935.10s] What aboutkind of a dual functionin that you've gotthe basic buttonsjust for your play volumeprogram thingsand then a menuto go intoand that's where you controlrecording and things like that.The other thing is SPEAKER_2
[947.10s -> 947.10s] just tucking into mobile phonedesign features againyou could have a flip top remote controlso that when you flip over the topyou can have a bigger screenin the flip over. SPEAKER_1
[949.10s -> 953.10s] I think that's a cost thing.I don't know how muchwe're going to know about it. SPEAKER_2
[959.10s -> 959.10s] It might save a bit of spaceinstead of looking bulkyit might look small. SPEAKER_0
[967.10s -> 971.10s] And there's no reasonwe need to make it lookas fashionable and stylishas a mobile phone.It can still be lightweight plastic.Something that's easily molded and produced. SPEAKER_1
[973.10s -> 989.10s] Sorry I'm treading on your territory guys.Right, okaywe've got half an hourfor the next meetingso we're all going to go offand do our individual things.I think that's probably about itand then we'll come backin the eight again. SPEAKER_2
[1005.10s -> 1005.10s] Just a quick thingabout what you were sayingabout theit doesn't need to be fashionableI had a quick look at thecompany websiteand it's likewe put the fashion into electronics SPEAKER_3
[1007.10s -> 1007.10s] so I think SPEAKER_1
[1015.10s -> 1015.10s] the whole design thing might beI mean you don'tyou can still have plasticand it looks quite good. SPEAKER_3
[1019.10s -> 1023.10s] It doesn't have to bethat was my main point.I don't know if using metalI don't know if using plastic SPEAKER_1
[1027.10s -> 1049.10s] does make it cheaperI presume it would.I mean the Sky remote controlsthey're kind of moldedand look a bit differentthan the Tally West remote controlsso fillable plasticlooks a bit smarter.Okayso let's break it up there.So see you in half an hour.Do we go backto our room? SPEAKER_2
[1051.10s -> 1051.10s] Yeah. SPEAKER_None
